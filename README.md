# Qfig

This's my libray of `shell` and `powershell` scripts.

To activate those commands in the scripts, run the script `activation.sh` in the terminal if you are using `unix-like` os, 
else run the script `activation.ps1` in the PowerShell if you are using `Windows` os

All commands are optional except `baseCommands.sh/ps1`, edit the `config` to choose. 
The script `tempCommands.sh/ps1` will be loaded if it exists, and will be ignored by `.gitignore`
