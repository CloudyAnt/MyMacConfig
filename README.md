# Qfig

This's my libray of `shell` and `powershell` scripts.

To activate those commands in the scripts, run the script `activation.sh` in the terminal if you are using `unix-like` os, 
else run the script `activation.ps1` in the PowerShell if you are using `Windows` os

Most of those commands are optional, edit the `myConfig.sh` or `myConfig.ps1` to choose.
