The repo contains some useful shell commands, and thery are easily to be updated. 

To activate these commands, run the script `activation.sh` in the terminal if you are using `unix-like` os, 
else run the script `activation.ps1` in the PowerShell if you are using `Windows` os

And then, I hava some recommendations of **Developing tools**, **Intellij plugins** .etc just in the below

## Developing tools

`Chrome`, best for developer

`Homebrew`, great package manager, it's similiar with `yum` & `apt-get`

*if connection refuesed, set your DNS Server to 8.8.8.8*

`iTerm`, better than terminal, by the way, `oh-my-zsh` is a good friend

`Postman`, useful for testing you apis

`tablePlus`, convenient DB GUI tool

`VSCode`, slight, quick coding experience

`Scroll Reverser`, just reverse mouse scroll, all in humanized way

`JetBrains IDEs`, pick as you needed

`Yuque`, good note taking software

`Sougou Input Method`, perferred software for chinese inputting
